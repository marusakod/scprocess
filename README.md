`scprocess` is a Snakemake pipeline designed to streamline and automate processing of single cell RNA sequencing data. Optimized for data generated using the **10x Genomics** technology, it provides a comprehensive solution that transforms raw sequencing files into standardized outputs suitable for a variety of downstream tasks. The pipeline is built to support the analysis of datasets comprising multiple (i.e. 100+) samples via a simple CLI.
